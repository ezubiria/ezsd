# Hi there!

I’m Erik Zubiria, a Spanish full stack videogame developer who lives in the center of the Netherlands, in Utrecht. And why in Utrecht? Because my girlfriend was unemployed in Spain and she decided to study a Master degree abroad, so we moved here and...

Mmm I’m beating around the bushes here… Let’s talk about my work, this page is about that.
I started using Unity 8 years ago. On September 2020 I published BATU ta BATU my first game for consoles and PC. The whole game was developed and designed by me.

After some demos my current project is the development of a classic Point & Click adventure game.

I also can create some art occasionally. I can even make music!
