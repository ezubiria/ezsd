# Other Stuff

During these years I’ve been able to create some projects besides videogame development. Here you can see some of them.

## Recording Art

## Music
One of my most beloved projects is Oklo, a musical project in which I composed /produced the songs and designed the art of the record. You can listen and download it here.

With the help of my friend Surtimen I created the music of BATU ta BATU rearranging some Oklo songs and creating new ones. Strongly influenced by electronic music from the ’80s and ’90s, Oklo has a touch of movie soundtracks while Surtimen feels more like darksynth. Without ever forgetting the chiptune!
