# Stuff I do

## A programmer in love with classic videogames

As a videogame fan since I was a kid in the early ’90s, I always wanted to be involved in the gaming industry so I started learning Unity 8 years ago. Having a background in web frontend/backend programming was essential for the understanding of C#. So, the learning curve with Unity went quite smooth. When it comes to art, I have always been curious about drawing so I learned on the go, adapting to the project’s needs. Here you can see some of the projects I have been involved these years.

### Batu ta Batu
My biggest videogame project so far, the main issue was to motivate myself from time to time to stay focused and finish it. It wasn’t easy sometimes, especially in mid development months.

Polishing the gameplay was also a big challenge. As a puzzle, the balance between difficulty and accessibility was crucial, so it took me a while to achieve this.

### Project Txapape
As a side project I developed also a sports game in VR. It is being developed for Oculus Quest.

The sport in the game is called “Pelota” (also known as Jai Alai) and it is a quite popular sport from the region where I come from in the north of Spain. It is basically a squash game but no racket is used! Players hit the ball with their bare hands!

# Other Stuff

During these years I’ve been able to create some projects besides videogame development. Here you can see some of them.

## Music
One of my most beloved projects is Oklo, a musical project in which I composed /produced the songs and designed the art of the record. You can listen and download it here.

With the help of my friend Surtimen I created the music of BATU ta BATU rearranging some Oklo songs and creating new ones. Strongly influenced by electronic music from the ’80s and ’90s, Oklo has a touch of movie soundtracks while Surtimen feels more like darksynth. Without ever forgetting the chiptune!
